Scalable datastore for metrics, events, and real-time analytics.

## Forked

This repository has been forked from https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-influxdb on: **20/07/2025**.

The only changes made are: The **'collectd'** plug-in has been enabled in the influxdb.conf, the collectd **types.db** has been added and the collectd port: **25826** has been exposed.

The best way to use would be to copy the 'influxdb' folder to your Home Assistant 'addons' folder, then in Home Assistant, refresh the add-on store and install from the 'Local add-ons'.

Also had to alter the Dockerfile due to some no longer available dependencies.


## About

InfluxDB is an open source time series database optimized for high-write-volume.
It's useful for recording metrics, sensor data, events,
and performing analytics. It exposes an HTTP API for client interaction and is
often used in combination with Grafana to visualize the data.

This add-on comes with Chronograf & Kapacitor pre-installed. These provide a
nice InfluxDB admin interface for managing your users, databases, data
retention settings, and let you peek inside the database using the Data
Explorer.
